            <p> Aakhor AI is an Assamese typing and language platform built to make writing Assamese digitally — simple
                and easy.
                Living in Assam, Assamese is not just a language we speak — it’s how we think, argue, joke, and express
                emotion. Yet, the moment we open a phone or laptop, most of us quietly switch to English. Not because we
                want to, but because writing Assamese digitally has always been difficult.
                I’ve felt that gap for years. And that’s why Aakhor AI stood out to me.

            <h2>Build Here, By Our Own People</h2>
            <p>Aakhor AI is developed by Indranil Talukdar and Kabyanil Talukdar, two brothers from Guwahati. They
                didn’t build this sitting far away from the problems Assamese speakers face. They built it right here,
                knowing exactly how uncomfortable typing Assamese can feel for most of us.
                Their aim wasn’t to impress the world. It was to solve a local problem — making Assamese easier to use
                in the digital age.</p>

            <h2>Typing Assamese Without Fear</h2>
            <p>For many of us, speaking Assamese comes naturally, but typing it doesn’t. Keyboard layouts feel
                confusing, spelling slows us down, and after a point, we give up and type in English.
                Aakhor changes that.
                You can type Assamese using English letters, and it converts the text instantly into proper Assamese. No
                prior typing experience needed. No memorising scripts. You simply type the way you pronounce the word,
                and Aakhor understands.
                This alone makes Assamese usable in our digital everyday.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>A Tool That Understands Our Language</h2>
            <p>Aakhor AI is trained on millions of Assamese words, which shows when you use it. As you type, it suggests
                multiple word options, helping you choose what fits your sentence naturally. The predictions don’t feel
                forced or artificial — they feel familiar.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond typing, Aakhor offers:
            <ul>
                <li>Instant translation into Assamese </li>
                <li>Synonyms and similar words</li>
                <li>Grammar and sentence improvements </li>
                <li>Word meanings with usage and context</li>
                <li>Question answering in Assamese</li>
                <li>A built-in dictionary</li>
                <li>Note saving and sharing</li>
                <li>A clean web editor that works on browsers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of this works across Windows, Mac, mobile devices, and uses Unicode, so the text stays compatible
                everywhere.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Speaking Instead of Typing</h2>
            <p>Another feature that feels genuinely useful is speech-to-text. You can speak into your device, and Aakhor
                converts your voice into Assamese text. It works across various age groups and different voices, making
                it
                especially helpful for long writing or for those who struggle with typing.</p>

            <p>For a language that lives strongly in spoken form, this feature feels important.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="editor-divider">
        <div>
            <h2>Why This Matters To Us</h2>
            <p>Assamese doesn’t need saving — it needs space to live.</p>
            <p>When people stop writing a language digitally, it slowly disappears from daily use. Aakhor AI makes it
                easier to write messages, notes, articles, and thoughts in Assamese without switching languages.</p>
            <p>This isn't about technology replacing culture. It's about technology supporting it .</p>
        </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <hr class="editor-divider">
        <div>
            <h2>A Step Forward, From Assam </h2>
            <p>Aakhor AI may not be perfect, but it is honest. It feels like a tool built with care, not hype. Knowing
                that it was created by people from Assam, for people who use Assamese daily, gives it a sense of trust.
            </p>
            <p>If more of us start writing in Assamese online — comfortably, confidently — that alone is a quiet
                revolution.</p>
            <p>And maybe, this is how our language stays alive in the digital world — not through speeches, but through
                everyday use.</p>
            <p>If you think in Assamese, write with <a href="https://aakhor.in/">Aakhor AI</a>.</p>
