# Aakhor AI Blog

A static website created to publish a personal experience–based article on a new regional AI platform focused on a local language, while learning the fundamentals of web development.

## About the Project
This project began as an unpublished article written for a college magazine that was not accepted.  
Instead of discarding it, I chose to improve the article, publish it independently, and use the opportunity to learn how to build and deploy a real website.

The focus of the article is *user experience and awareness*, not technical analysis.  
It aims to encourage first-time users and non-technical audiences to explore and adopt a new regional AI platform.

## Purpose
- Publish an independent awareness article online
- Learn the basics of web development by building something real
- Understand deployment and hosting workflows


## Scope & Limitations
- This is *not* a technical deep dive into AI architecture
- It is *not* an official or affiliated website
- The project is intentionally kept simple and static


## Features
- Clean, reading-focused layout
- Static pages for fast load times
- SEO-ready structure 
- Deployed and publicly accessible

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS

## Design Choices
- A static site was chosen for simplicity, speed, and ease of deployment
- Minimal design to keep focus on written content
- No heavy frameworks to keep the learning process transparent
